Start of Programming Module.

My goal within this module is not to be a "master coder", instead just to feel comfortable with the Unity Engine and using C# programming
The aim is to simply be able to think of an idea for a game and be able to confidently make a working prototype of the core mechanics if I ever needed to pitch or deicde to make my own projects.

I think this will be a really important module for me as a game design student as I am not entirely confident in using Unity as an engine as well as code so hopefully this will give me the confidence I need to bettering my Game Design knowledge in general

Today I watched a tutorial by Brackeys on how to control a character in a 3D space with full 3rd Person camera tracking.

It was a fairly simple and a very well made tutorial. The camera was controlled by Cinemachine which is a camera based package for Unity which improves upon the Unity camera system.

The outcome was rather good and I was really proud of myself for being able to complete it, I actually took in quite a bit of information as well, and starting to understand floats and public gameObjects etc which before went straight over my head.

My aim for future weeks is to continue using the same Unity Project and build upon what I already have. That way I feel like this will help me understand how multiple lines of code interact with one another and also may help with my debugging process and build up my confidence on that as well.

I am creating a Youtube Playlist for videos and tutorials for assiting me with the code I wish to learn for the future weeks

Below is a (very) rough outline of what I want to accomplish each week within lecture time:

Week 3: Add a pickup system (possibly with UI score count)
Week 4: Add Instantiate shoot mechanic
Week 5: Add particles to the gun (camera shake + juice)
Week 6: Add targets to shoot
Week 7: Add First Person toggle

*These above plans are planned for in lecture time (2 hours each) however to get things completed and stay on track I plan to do independent work*
